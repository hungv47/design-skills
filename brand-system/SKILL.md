# Brand Identity & Design System Generator

*Design — Step 1 of 2. Transform product artifacts into a complete brand identity and design system.*

**Core Question:** "Does every visual decision trace back to who we are?"

## Inputs Required
- Product description or PRD (what the product does, who it serves)
- Target audience profile (demographics, psychographics, context of use)
- Competitive context (who else serves this audience, how they're positioned)

## Output
- `.agents/design/brand-system.md` (brand identity, voice, visual system, design tokens)
- Visual brand guideline artboards (if Paper MCP available)

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Every visual, verbal, and token decision traces back to strategy and archetype
- [ ] Values have real tradeoffs (not generic "innovation, quality, integrity")
- [ ] Voice chart has Do/Don't examples for every attribute
- [ ] All semantic tokens have both light and dark mode values
- [ ] Every token pair meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large/UI)
- [ ] Background/foreground convention used consistently (`bg-primary text-primary-foreground`)
- [ ] One global `--radius` value — all components derive from it
- [ ] Cross-element coherence: radius maps to archetype (see `references/token-templates.md`), type personality matches archetype (see `references/typography-psychology.md`), color emotion aligns with brand personality (see `references/color-emotion.md`), and imagery direction reflects the archetype's visual world. Flag any element that contradicts the others.
- [ ] AI slop check: run `references/ai-slop-detection.md` checklist against all visual outputs — 0-1 items is clean, 2-3 needs review, 4+ needs regeneration

## Chain Position
Previous: none | Next: `user-flow`

**Re-run triggers:** After major product pivots, when entering new markets, after significant audience shifts, or annually for brand refresh.

**Related skills (non-chain):** `icp-research` (audience data for brand strategy), `content-create` (consumes voice guidelines), `humanize` (uses voice adjectives)

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Gather Context

**Required inputs** — interview if missing:
- Product description or PRD
- Target audience profile
- Competitive context

**Strongly recommended:**
- Existing brand assets (logos, colors, fonts, past guidelines)
- Founder/team values and origin story
- Key differentiators

**Helpful:**
- Admired brands (aspirational and anti-aspirational)
- Market positioning intent (premium, accessible, disruptive, trusted)

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `.agents/product-context.md` | icp-research (from `hungv47/comms-skills`) | Product positioning, audience, and voice adjectives — grounds brand strategy in audience research |
| `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md` | icp-research (from `hungv47/comms-skills`) | Audience personas, pain profiles, and VoC quotes — brand strategy without audience research produces generic archetypes |

**Strongly recommended:** Run `icp-research` (from comms-skills) first if audience research hasn't been done. Brand strategy built on assumed audiences produces generic, untested archetypes.

If upstream artifacts' `date` fields are older than 30 days, recommend re-running `icp-research` before proceeding — audience insights evolve and stale data produces misaligned brand strategy.

### Mode Selection

| Mode | When | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| **Full Brand System** | Established product, full rebrand, comprehensive guidelines needed | All 13 steps (Parts I + II) |
| **Quick Brand** | MVP, early-stage, need to ship fast with basic brand foundations | Steps 1-7 only (through Step 7: Messaging Architecture) — defers visual identity, tokens, and components |

Ask: *"Full brand system or quick brand for MVP?"*

**Quick Brand** covers: Purpose/mission/vision, core values, positioning, archetype, personality, voice/tone, messaging architecture. Defers: visual identity, token architecture, component tokens, accessibility/dark mode, and Paper artboards. Quick Brand output includes a note: "Run full brand-system when ready to build the design system."

Missing product details are not guessable — interview for them.

# Part I: Brand Identity

## Step 1: Brand Strategy Foundation

Define the bedrock everything else builds on.

### Purpose, Mission, Vision

```
PURPOSE (why we exist — beyond money): [One sentence]
MISSION (what we do, for whom, how): [1-2 sentences, present-tense, action-oriented]
VISION (future state we're building toward): [One sentence, aspirational but believable]
```

### Core Values

3-5 values. Each specific enough to guide real decisions. **Test**: if the opposite is obviously stupid, the value is too generic. Good values have a real tradeoff ("transparency over comfort").

```
1. [Value]: [What it means in practice — a specific behavioral standard]
2. [Value]: [What it means in practice]
3. [Value]: [What it means in practice]
```

### Brand Positioning

```
POSITIONING: For [target audience], [brand] is the only [category] that [difference] because [proof].
PROMISE: [One sentence — single most important commitment to customers]
VALUE PROP: We help [who] do [what] by [how], so they can [outcome].
```

### Competitive Landscape

```
PERCEPTUAL MAP:
  Axis 1: [e.g., Affordable ←→ Premium]
  Axis 2: [e.g., Traditional ←→ Innovative]
  Our position: [where and why]
  White space: [opportunity this position exploits]

KEY COMPETITORS:
  - [Competitor A]: [position]. Weakness: [gap we exploit].
  - [Competitor B]: [position]. Weakness: [gap we exploit].
```

---

## Step 2: Brand Personality & Archetype

Select one primary (70%) and one secondary (30%) archetype from the 12 Jungian archetypes. Reference `references/brand-archetypes.md` for the complete guide.

```
Primary (70%): [Archetype] — [why it fits core desire and strategy]
Secondary (30%): [Archetype] — [nuance it adds]

In action: How we inspire / communicate / make people feel / what we'd never do
```

### Personality Traits

3-5 traits using "trait, but not" format to prevent misinterpretation:

```
1. [Trait] — but not [extreme to avoid]. In practice: [example]
2. [Trait] — but not [extreme]. In practice: [example]
3. [Trait] — but not [extreme]. In practice: [example]
```

### Emotional Journey Map

```
Before product: [emotional state]  →  During: [transformation]  →  After: [desired outcome]
CORE TENSION: [problem/desire resolved]
DESIGN PROMISE: [what the entire brand experience communicates]
```

---

## Step 3: Brand Voice & Tone

Voice is constant (personality in words). Tone is variable (shifts by context). Reference `references/brand-voice.md` for frameworks.

### Voice Chart

3-5 attributes with Do/Don't examples:

```
| Attribute | Description | Do | Don't |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-------|
| [Attr]    | [Meaning]   | [Right example] | [Wrong example] |
```

### Tone Spectrum

Map across NN/g dimensions, then specify tone by context (marketing, product UI, help docs, errors, social).

### On-Brand vs Off-Brand Examples

Provide side-by-side examples for: welcome email, error message, CTA button.

---

## Step 4: Messaging Architecture

```
TAGLINE (2-7 words): [memorable, ownable, evocative]
ELEVATOR PITCH (25 words): [what, for whom, why it matters]
VALUE PROPOSITION (1-2 sentences): [functional + emotional benefits]

MESSAGING PILLARS (3-5):
  Pillar N: [Headline] → Narrative (2-3 sentences) → Proof points

BOILERPLATE: One-liner (10w) | Short (50w) | Standard (100w) | Full (200w)
```

---

## Step 5: Visual Identity System

Every visual decision traces to archetype, personality, and positioning. Reference `references/visual-identity.md` for detailed logo, imagery, and iconography rules.

### Logo System
Primary lockup, secondary, logomark, wordmark. Define clear space, minimum size, color variations, usage rules.

### Color System
Colors serve the emotional journey and archetype. Reference `references/color-emotion.md` for color psychology. Provide values in all formats: Hex, OKLCH, Pantone, CMYK, RGB.

```
PRIMARY (60%): [Name] [hex] [oklch] — emotional purpose traced to archetype
SECONDARY (30%): [Name] [values] — supporting role
ACCENT (10%): [Name] [values] — CTAs, highlights, celebration
SEMANTIC: Success / Warning / Error / Info
NEUTRALS: Full 50-950 scale
```

### Typography System
Select fonts embodying archetype and personality. Reference `references/typography-psychology.md`. Maximum 2 families (3 if mono needed). Define full type hierarchy (H1 through caption).

### Imagery & Iconography
Photography mood, lighting, color treatment, subjects, composition. Icon style (line/filled/duotone), stroke weight, grid, color rules. Brand devices (patterns, shapes, textures).

# Part II: Design System

## Step 6: Token Architecture

Three-layer system (W3C Design Tokens spec, shadcn/ui-inspired):

```
PRIMITIVE (what exists)   →  color.blue.500, spacing.4, font.size.md
SEMANTIC (what it means)  →  --primary, --muted-foreground, --border
COMPONENT (where it goes) →  button.primary.background, input.border.default
```

**Background/foreground convention**: Every semantic role comes as a pair. Base name = background/fill. `-foreground` suffix = text/icon on that surface. Pair them: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`.

**Color format**: OKLCH primary, hex fallbacks.

Reference `references/token-architecture.md` for the complete spec and `references/token-templates.md` for primitive scales, semantic token map, radius-to-archetype mapping, and a full mapping example.

---

## Step 7: Component Tokens & Patterns

Map semantic tokens to specific components. Reference `references/component-tokens.md` for full component token map (buttons, inputs, cards, badges), button hierarchy with sizes, form element specs, card specs, and motion/interaction tokens.

Reference `references/component-patterns.md` for extended UI component patterns with token consumption maps.

Key principles:
- One primary button per view maximum
- Buttons: 6 variants (primary, secondary, destructive, outline, ghost, link)
- Inputs: validate on blur, not keystroke
- Motion: instant/fast/normal/slow timing scale, ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting

---

## Step 8: Accessibility & Dark Mode

Reference `references/implementation-rules.md` for full accessibility baseline (WCAG 2.1 AA), dark mode rules, and brand application templates.

Key requirements:
- **Contrast**: 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text and UI components
- **Targets**: 44x44px minimum touch targets, 8px spacing between
- **Focus**: Visible ring on all interactive elements — never remove without replacement
- **Color independence**: Pair color with icons, labels, patterns, or position
- **Motion safety**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Dark mode**: Parallel track from Step 1. Reduce saturation and shift lightness — avoid inverting. Surface hierarchy, not just "black."

---

## Step 9: Visual Artboard Generation (Paper MCP)

Render brand guidelines as 5 presentation-ready artboards if Paper MCP is available. Reference `references/artboard-generation.md` for complete specs, workflow, and prerequisites.

After generating artboards, run the AI slop detection checklist (`references/ai-slop-detection.md`). Artboards are the highest-risk output for AI default patterns because they're visual-first and the agent may lean on familiar layouts instead of archetype-driven decisions.

Artboards: Color Palette | Typography System | Spacing & Tokens | UI Style Principles | Logo System

Skip this step if Paper MCP tools are unavailable.

---

## Process Summary

1. **Gather** — product docs, audience, competitors, existing assets
2. **Strategy** — purpose, mission, vision, values, positioning
3. **Archetype** — primary + secondary, rationale traced to strategy
4. **Personality** — 3-5 traits in "trait, but not" format
5. **Voice** — voice chart, tone spectrum, writing guidelines
6. **Messaging** — tagline through boilerplate, pillars with proof
7. **Visual identity** — logo, colors, type, imagery, icons
8. **Primitives** — neutral base, color scales (OKLCH), type, spacing, radius
9. **Semantic tokens** — map primitives to UI roles using bg/fg pairs
10. **Components** — token consumption maps, button/input/card specs
11. **Accessibility + dark mode** — WCAG AA, parallel dark track
12. **Applications** — brand across touchpoints
13. **Artboards** — render in Paper MCP (if available), screenshot and refine

## Artifact Template

Save to `.agents/design/brand-system.md`.

On re-run: rename existing artifact to `brand-system.v[N].md` and create new with incremented version.

## Part V: Implementation
- Accessibility, dark mode, brand applications (see references/)
```

## Worked Example (Condensed)

**Input**: FinLit — a personal finance app for young professionals (22-30), positioned against intimidating banking apps.

**Strategy**: Purpose: make finance empowering, not shameful. Positioning: the only finance app that feels like a supportive friend, not a stern banker.

**Archetype**: Caregiver (70%) + Explorer (30%). Warm, supportive core with curiosity and growth.

**Voice**: Encouraging but not patronizing. "You've got this" energy. Casual-leaning, never jargon-heavy.

**Visual**: Primary: warm teal (`oklch(0.65 0.15 180)` / `#2cbaa0`). Neutral base: Stone (warm gray). Display: Plus Jakarta Sans. Body: Inter. Radius: 0.5rem (friendly, Caregiver). Imagery: real people, natural light, warm tones.

**Tokens**: `--primary: stone.50/stone.950` (light/dark bg). `--primary: teal.600/teal.400`. `--radius: 0.5rem`. All pairs verified 4.5:1+.

## Anti-Patterns

### Brand
- **Aesthetics without strategy** — picking colors or fonts because they "look nice" without tracing back to archetype and positioning. Every visual choice needs a strategy justification.
- **Visual-first thinking** — choosing colors/fonts before strategy makes the brand feel hollow
- **Generic values** — "innovation, quality, integrity" have no tradeoff; they guide nothing
- **Archetype confusion** — commit to one primary; the secondary adds nuance, not contradiction
- **Voice without examples** — "we're friendly" is meaningless without a concrete error message example

### Design System
- **Token soup** — ~20 semantic tokens cover an entire component library; more creates decision paralysis
- **Skipping semantic layer** — components reference semantic tokens, not primitives directly
- **Mismatched pairs** — `bg-primary text-primary` is wrong; use `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`
- **Hex-only thinking** — use OKLCH for perceptually uniform manipulation; hex for readability
- **Dark mode as inversion** — requires deliberate surface hierarchy, not black/white flip

### Visual Artboards
- **Batching entire artboards** — one visual group per `write_html` call
- **Using grid/margins/tables** — Paper is flex-only; use `display: flex`, `gap`, `padding`
- **Unchecked fonts** — call `get_font_family_info` before using any font family
- **Skipping screenshots** — `get_screenshot` every 2-3 `write_html` calls
- **Artboards before markdown** — Parts I-III are source of truth; artboards visualize them
