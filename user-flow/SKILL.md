description: "This skill should be invoked when the user wants to map how users navigate through an app or product -- screens, decisions, transitions, and edge cases. Triggers include 'create a user flow', 'map the user journey', 'plan screen transitions', 'users are getting lost', 'the flow is confusing', 'our onboarding sucks', 'users are dropping off', 'what happens after signup', or 'plan the UX' -- even if they just describe a feature and need to figure out the screens. Works for web, mobile, SaaS, e-commerce, onboarding, checkout. Not for visual brand design (use brand-system)."

# User Flow Design

*Design — Step 2 of 2. Maps navigation paths, decision points, and screen-to-screen transitions into a validated flow diagram.*

**Core Question:** "Can the user complete their goal without thinking?"

## Inputs Required
- A product or feature requiring flow mapping (new feature, redesign, or existing flow audit)
- Target user role or persona (flows change per role)
- The user goal the flow serves (one goal per flow)

## Output
- `.agents/design/user-flow.md`

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Every decision point has ≥2 labeled exits (including the unhappy path)
- [ ] Error paths lead to recovery states — no dead ends
- [ ] Entry and exit points are explicit (not implied)
- [ ] Flow serves exactly one user goal — split if multiple goals emerged
- [ ] Empty, loading, and permission states are accounted for
- [ ] Back/cancel actions are defined at every step where the user might retreat

## Chain Position
Previous: `brand-system` (optional — provides design tokens and component context) | Next: handoff to implementation

**Re-run triggers:** When product features change significantly, when user research reveals new patterns, after usability testing reveals flow issues, or when adding new user roles.

**Related skills (non-chain):** `system-architecture` (consumes flow diagrams for API design), `task-breakdown` (uses flows for feature decomposition), `plan-interviewer` (generates specs that inform flows)

---

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context
Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing: **INTERVIEW.** Interview for product dimensions (what, who, problem, differentiator, constraints) and save to `.agents/product-context.md`. Or recommend running `icp-research (from hungv47/comms-skills)` to bootstrap it.

If `.agents/product-context.md` has a `date` field older than 30 days, recommend re-running `icp-research` to refresh it before proceeding.

### Required Artifacts
None — this skill can run standalone.

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research (from hungv47/comms-skills) | Product and user context for better flow decisions |
| `.agents/design/brand-system.md` | brand-system | Component inventory and design tokens inform screen-level detail |

### Flow Interview
Interview for these dimensions before proceeding:

**Product context**
1. What product or feature needs flow mapping?
2. What problem does it solve for the user?
3. Who is the primary user? (role, technical skill, frequency of use)

**Flow scope**
4. What is the single user goal this flow serves?
5. Where does the flow start? (specific trigger: link click, app launch, notification tap)
6. What does success look like? (specific end state)
7. Are there existing flows to reference, replace, or extend?

**Constraints**
8. Platform — web, iOS, Android, cross-platform?
9. Authentication requirements? (logged in, guest, role-based)
10. Technical or business rules that force specific paths?

---

## Step 1: Assess Flow Complexity

Classify the flow to set structural expectations:

| Type | Pattern | When to use | Typical depth |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Linear** | A → B → C → Done | Onboarding, tutorials, checkout | 3-8 screens |
| **Branching** | A → B or C based on condition | Personalization, role-based access | 5-15 screens |
| **Cyclical** | A → B → C → A (loop) | Dashboards, feeds, iterative editing | 4-10 screens per cycle |
| **Hub-and-spoke** | Hub → {A, B, C} → Hub | Settings, multi-feature navigation | 1 hub + 3-8 spokes |

For flows exceeding 15 screens, decompose into sub-flows — each sub-flow is its own diagram with labeled entry/exit connectors.

---

## Step 2: Map Flow Structure

Define all components before visualization:

### Entry points
List every way a user enters this flow (deep link, menu tap, redirect, notification). Each entry point becomes a start node.

### Core screens and states
For each screen, capture:
- **Screen name** — concrete label, not generic ("Payment Method Selection", not "Step 3")
- **Purpose** — what the user decides or accomplishes here
- **User actions** — every interactive element (tap, type, swipe, toggle)
- **System responses** — what happens after each action (API call, validation, animation)

### Decision points
For each branch:
- **Condition** — exact rule ("cart total > $50", "user.role === 'admin'")
- **Exits** — label every outgoing path, including the default/fallback
- **Who decides** — user choice vs. system logic vs. data-driven

### Edge cases
Account for these states at every screen where they apply:
- **Error** — validation failure, server error, timeout → recovery path
- **Empty** — no data, first use → onboarding or placeholder
- **Loading** — async operations → skeleton or spinner
- **Permission** — insufficient access → upgrade prompt or redirect
- **Offline** — no connectivity → cached state or retry

### Exit points
Label each exit:
- **Success** — goal achieved
- **Abandonment** — user leaves mid-flow (track where)
- **Error terminal** — unrecoverable failure (with support/retry option)
- **Redirect** — flow hands off to another flow

---

## Step 3: Create Flow Diagram

### Notation standards

Use Mermaid `graph TD` with these node shapes consistently:

| Shape | Meaning | Mermaid syntax |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Rounded rectangle | Screen / page | `[Screen Name]` |
| Diamond | Decision point | `{Condition?}` |
| Stadium | Start / end | `([Start])` or `([End])` |
| Hexagon | System process | `{{Process}}` |
| Parallelogram | External input/output | `[/Input/]` |

### Label conventions
- Edge labels describe the trigger or condition: `-->|"Clicks Submit"|`
- Use present tense: "Enters email", not "User enters email"
- Decision exits use exact conditions: `-->|"Valid"|` and `-->|"Invalid"|`

### Diagram construction

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start([User opens app])
    Start --> AuthCheck{Authenticated?}
    AuthCheck -->|"Yes"| Dashboard[Dashboard]
    AuthCheck -->|"No"| Login[Login Screen]
    Login -->|"Submits credentials"| Validate{{Validate credentials}}
    Validate -->|"Valid"| Dashboard
    Validate -->|"Invalid"| LoginError[Error: Invalid credentials]
    LoginError -->|"Retries"| Login
    Login -->|"Taps 'Forgot password'"| Reset[Password Reset Flow]
    Login -->|"Taps 'Sign up'"| Signup[Signup Flow]
    Dashboard -->|"Logs out"| Login
```

### Annotations
Add annotations below the diagram for logic that does not fit in edge labels:

```
**Annotations:**
1. AuthCheck: Uses JWT token expiry. Tokens refresh silently if < 24h expired.
2. Validate: Rate-limited to 5 attempts/15min. After limit → CAPTCHA gate.
3. LoginError: Displays generic message — avoid revealing whether email exists.
```

### Sub-flow references
For complex flows, split into named sub-flows and link them:
```
→ [See: Signup Sub-flow] (entry: "Taps 'Sign up'" from Login)
→ [See: Password Reset Sub-flow] (entry: "Taps 'Forgot password'" from Login)
```

---

## Step 4: Validate

Run through these checks:

**Structural integrity**
- Trace every path from every entry point to an exit — no orphan screens
- Confirm every decision diamond has ≥2 labeled exits
- Verify no screen is unreachable

**Completeness**
- Error states exist for every action that can fail
- Back/cancel is available wherever the user might want to retreat
- Empty and loading states are noted where data is fetched

**Usability**
- Happy path is ≤7 steps from entry to success (Miller's threshold)
- No unnecessary decision points — if the system can decide, automate it
- Cognitive load per screen is manageable (≤3 primary actions)

**Handoff readiness**
- Screen names match what developers and designers will use
- Conditions on decision points are implementable (not vague)
- Async operations are identified (API calls, file uploads, payment processing)

Iterate with the user on any gaps found.

## Worked Example

**User:** "Map the checkout flow for our e-commerce app."

**Interview:**
- "What platform?" → "Mobile app, iOS and Android"
- "Who is the user?" → "Logged-in customer with items in cart"
- "Where does the flow start?" → "User taps 'Checkout' from cart"
- "What's the success state?" → "Order confirmed, confirmation screen shown"
- "Constraints?" → "Must support Apple Pay, credit card, and PayPal. Minimum order $10."

**Complexity assessment:** Branching flow — payment method selection creates 3 parallel paths.

**Artifact saved to `.agents/design/user-flow.md`:**

```markdown
# User Flow: Mobile Checkout

## Context
- **Product:** E-commerce mobile app
- **User:** Logged-in customer
- **Goal:** Complete purchase from cart
- **Platform:** iOS + Android
- **Flow type:** Branching

## Flow Diagram

​```mermaid
graph TD
    Start([Taps 'Checkout' from Cart])
    Start --> MinCheck{Cart ≥ $10?}
    MinCheck -->|"No"| MinError[Error: Minimum $10 required]
    MinError -->|"Returns to cart"| End1([Back to Cart])
    MinCheck -->|"Yes"| Address[Shipping Address]
    Address -->|"Confirms address"| Shipping[Shipping Method]
    Address -->|"Taps 'Cancel'"| End1
    Shipping -->|"Selects method"| Payment[Payment Selection]
    Payment -->|"Apple Pay"| ApplePay{{Apple Pay Sheet}}
    Payment -->|"Credit Card"| CardEntry[Card Entry Form]
    Payment -->|"PayPal"| PayPalRedirect{{PayPal Redirect}}
    ApplePay -->|"Authorized"| Review[Order Review]
    ApplePay -->|"Declined"| PayError[Payment Error]
    CardEntry -->|"Valid card"| Review
    CardEntry -->|"Invalid"| CardError[Validation Error]
    CardError -->|"Corrects"| CardEntry
    PayPalRedirect -->|"Approved"| Review
    PayPalRedirect -->|"Cancelled"| Payment
    PayError -->|"Tries again"| Payment
    Review -->|"Confirms order"| Processing{{Process Payment}}
    Processing -->|"Success"| Confirmation[Order Confirmation]
    Processing -->|"Failure"| PayError
    Confirmation --> End2([Done])
​```

**Annotations:**
1. MinCheck: Evaluated on cart subtotal before tax/shipping.
2. ApplePay: Uses Stripe Apple Pay SDK. Falls back to card entry if unavailable.
3. Processing: 3-second timeout → retry once, then show PayError.

## Screen Inventory

| # | Screen | Purpose | Actions | Next States |
|---|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Shipping Address | Confirm/edit delivery address | Confirm, Edit, Cancel | Shipping Method, Cart |
| 2 | Shipping Method | Select delivery speed | Select option | Payment Selection |
| 3 | Payment Selection | Choose payment method | Apple Pay, Card, PayPal | Respective payment flow |
| 4 | Card Entry Form | Enter card details | Submit, Back | Order Review, Validation Error |
| 5 | Order Review | Final confirmation | Confirm, Edit, Cancel | Processing, previous screens |
| 6 | Order Confirmation | Success state | View order, Continue shopping | Done |

## Edge Cases Handled

| State | Screen(s) | Handling |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Error | Payment flows | Return to Payment Selection with message |
| Empty | Shipping Address | Pre-fill from profile, prompt if missing |
| Loading | Processing | Spinner with "Processing payment..." — disable back button |
| Permission | Apple Pay | Hide option if device doesn't support it |

## Validation Summary

- Happy path length: 5 steps (Address → Shipping → Payment → Review → Confirmation)
- Decision points: 3 (minimum check, payment method, payment result)
- Error recovery paths: 3 (minimum order, card validation, payment failure)
- Dead ends: 0
```
